Steganography is the art of hiding the fact that communication is taking place, by hiding information in another information. Steganography hides the data in another file in such a way that only the recipient is aware of its existence. Various popular formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the internet. For hiding secret information in images there exists a large variety of techniques with their respective pros and cons.

In order to safely transmit confidential data multimedia objects such as video, audio and images are used as cover sources to hide the data. In image steganography the data is encoded into the cover image thus, generating a new image known as stego-image.

In our daily life we use many secure pathways like internet and telephone to share information, but the safety of data cannot be assured at certain levels. In order to share information in a concealed and discreet manner two methods can be used:
1. Cryptography
2. Steganography

In cryptography the message is modified in an encrypted form with the help of an encryption key, known to the sender and receiver, exclusively. The encrypted message cannot be accessed by anyone without using the encryption key (A very common example of cryptography is whatsapp). However, transmission of encrypted messages can arouse the suspicion of attackers and the message may be intercepted. In order to overcome the shortcomings of cryptography steganography has been developed.
